# is for id
. is for class
-difference between element and node:
->element is just <div></div>- every tag element
->node is <div> + text - the tag elements + the text between them, empty space is also considered part of the node!!!

-difference between button.addEventListener('click', onClick) and button.addEventListener('click', onClick())
-> in first case we call the function on click, in the second, we call the function inside the eventListener,
therefore we break the functionality and the function is called every time the page loads and NOT on click!!!

-how to remove event listener?
-> button.removeEventListener('click', onClick);

-'mousemove' eventlistener -> example: window.addEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove);
->triggers the event each time the mouse is moved. (millenium/nexo probably use this event listener for their home page).

-difference between target and currentTarget:
-> *target is the element that triggered the event (e.g., the user clicked on) (елемента, който тригерира дадения event)
   *currentTarget is the element that the event listener is attached to. (елемента в/у който event-a е закачен)
->Спестява ни това да закачаме event на всеки бутон, като можем да закачим само на техния parent.

-difference between append() and appendChild()
->append() allows you to add multiple items while appendChild() allows only a single item.

-difference between innerText and textContent
->The innerText property returns the text, without spacing and the textContent property returns the text along with spacing.

innerText returns the visible text contained in a node, while textContent returns the full text. 
For example, on the following HTML <span>Hello <span style="display: none;">World</span></span>, innerText will return 'Hello', while textContent will return 'Hello World'.
As a result, innerText is much more performance-heavy: it requires layout information to return the result.
innerText is defined only for HTMLElement objects, while textContent is defined for all Node objects.

-why wrap collections in Array.from()?
-because we get an HTML collection and need to convert this collection to array, in order to use js functions on it
-> Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('input[type=button]'))
